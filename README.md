Oregon Wolf Location Story Map

	We contacted the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife about acquiring the geospatial data from the wolves’ radio collars, and should be receiving that data shortly.  This data will consist of shapefiles that show the long-term migration patterns of individuals, as well as patterns that can indicate presence of a mate or offspring, that can both be used for historical markers and notes.  The geospatial data can be found here: https://nrimp.dfw.state.or.us/DataClearinghouse/default.aspx?p=202&XMLname=41160.xml Additional information about the Oregon wolves can be found here: https://dfw.state.or.us/Wolves/annual_reports.asp 

Also, we would be able to observe formations and break offs between wolf packs and the their territories. We would symbolize migration routes with arrows and dashed lines, and territories with colored polygons.

Our story map will be used as an educational tool for the public to learn about these animals, their travelling paths, history, and legislation information. We want to increase exposure so they become more normalized to humans, and lower the apparent fear that is associated with this creature.

	The storymap titled “The Journey of a Semipalmated Sandpiper” (https://manometinc.maps.arcgis.com/apps/Cascade/index.html?appid=e91643ee51ee4ae2bf6cd93eb09ee30e) is a very refined geoviz that shows a map that is similar to what we hope to produce.  Another one titled “Rickshaw Run” also has maps and formatting that would be good to go off of, although both of these geoviz sites are very sleek and refined.
